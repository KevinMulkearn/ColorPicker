        About:\n
        Primary colors are any of a group of colors from
        which all other colours can be obtained by mixing.
        In real world applications the most common colors
        chosen are red, blue, and yellow. When it come to
        representing colors digitally, the RGB24 (red, green,
        blue) model is most popular. This scheme restricts the
        number of available values to 8 bits in three color
        channels with values of 0–255. This means that any
        given color can be one of 16,777,216 possible colors.
        This App lets you play around with this model and lets
        you generate your own \"unique\" colors.
        The generated values are then converted into
        Hexadecimal and HSV representation.\n\n
        How to Use:\n
        Move the slider to select a value from 0 to 255.
        Do this for each primary color to get your desired
        color. When a desired color is found you can copy the
        hexadecimal value to your clipboard (via the save option
        from the menu in the top right). You can also generate
        random colors, if desired.
