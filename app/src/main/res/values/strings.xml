        About:\n
        Primary colors are any of a group of colors from\n
        which all other colours can be obtained by mixing.\n
        In real world applications the most common colors\n
        chosen are red, blue, and yellow. When it come to\n
        representing colors digitally, the RGB24 (red, green,\n
        blue) model is most popular. This scheme restricts the\n
        number of available values to 8 bits in three color\n
        channels with values of 0–255. This means that any\n
        given color can be one of 16,777,216 possible colors.\n
        This App lets you play around with this model and lets\n
        you generate your own \"unique\" colors.\n
        The generated values are then converted into\n
        Hexadecimal and HSV representation.\n\n
        How to Use:\n
        Move the slider to select a value from 0 to 255.\n
        Do this for each primary color to get your desired\n
        color. When a desired color is found you can copy the\n
        hexadecimal value to your clipboard (via the save option\n
        from the menu in the top right). You can also generate\n
        random colors, if desired.
